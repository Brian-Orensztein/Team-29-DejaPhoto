     * Class Philosophy:
     *
     * PhotoService manages user interactions with the UI, and prefers delegating low level tasks
     * to other classes - it only cares when and where the user clicks. ReleaseController handles
     * the sordid responsibilities of releasing photos from the DisplayCycle and the controlled
     * chaos of notifying other users through the cloud when a shared photo is released.
     *
     * This class is intended to be composed within PhotoService, and since PhotoService just cares
     * when and where a user clicks on the UI, ReleaseController exposes only one public method:
     * releasePhoto(). Any concomitant responsibilities are kept private, so as not to disturb the
     * service, who God knows has enough to worry about already.
